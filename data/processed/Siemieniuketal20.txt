ABSTRACT 
OBJECTIVE 

To compare the effects of treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). 
DESIGN 

Livingsystematicreviewand networkmeta-analysis. 
DATA SOURCES 

WHO covid-19 database, a comprehensive multilingual source of global covid-19 literature, up to 3 December 2020 and six additional Chinese databases up to 12 November 2020. 
STUDY SELECTION 

Randomised clinical trials in which people with suspected, probable, or confirmed covid-19 were randomised to drug treatment or to standard care or placebo. Pairs of reviewers independently screened potentially eligible articles. 
METHODS 

After duplicate data abstraction, a bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted. Risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using a modification of the Cochrane risk of bias 2.0 tool, and the certainty of the evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) approach. For each outcome, interventions were classified in groups from the most to the least beneficial or harmful following GRADE guidance. 
RESULTS 

85 trials enrolling 41 669 patients met inclusion criteria as of 21 October 2020; 50 (58.8%) trials and 25 081 (60.2%) patients are new from the previous iteration;43 (50.6%) trialsevaluating treatmentswith at least 100 patients or 20 events met the threshold for inclusion inthe analyses. Compared withstandard care, corticosteroids probably reduce death (risk difference 17 fewer per 1000 patients, 95% credible interval 34 fewer to 1 more, moderate certainty), mechanical ventilation (29 fewer per 1000 patients, 54 fewer to 1 more, moderate certainty), and days freefrom mechanical ventilation(2.6 fewer, 0.2 fewer to 5.0 fewer, moderate certainty). The impact of remdesivir on mortality, mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, and duration of symptoms is uncertain, but it probably does not substantially increase adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation (0 more per 1000,9 fewerto40 more, moderate certainty). Azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon-beta,andtocilizumab maynot reduce risk of death or have an effect on any other patient-important outcome. The certainty in effects for all other interventions was low or very low. 
CONCLUSION 
Corticosteroids probably reduce mortality and mechanical ventilation in patients with covid-19 comparedwith standardcare, whereas azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine,interferon-beta,andtocilizumab may not reduce either. Whether or not remdesivir confers any patient-important benefit remains uncertain.

Introduction 
As of 8 December 2020, more than 67 million people have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19); of these, 1.5 million have died.1 
Despite global efforts to identify effective interventions for the prevention and treatment of covid-19, which have resulted in 2400 trials completed or underway,2 
evidence for effective treatment remains limited. 
Faced with the pressures of a global pandemic, healthcare workers around the world are prescribing drugs off-label for which there is only very low quality evidence. Timely evidence summaries and associated guidelines could ameliorate the problem.3 
Clinicians, patients, guideline bodies, and government agencies are also facing the challenges of interpreting the results from trials that are being published at a rate never encountered previously. This environment makes it necessary to produce well developed summaries that distinguish more trustworthy evidence from less trustworthy evidence. 


Living systematic reviews deal with the main limitation of traditional reviews—that of providing an overview of the relevant evidence only at a specific time.4 
This is crucial in the context of covid-19, in which the best evidence is constantly changing. The ability of a living network meta-analysis to present a complete, broad, and updated view of the evidence makes it the best type of evidence synthesis to inform the development of practice recommendations. Network meta-analysis, rather than pairwise meta-analysis, provides useful information about the comparative effectiveness of treatments that have not been tested head to head. The lack of such direct comparisons is certain to limit inferences in the covid-19 setting. Moreover, the incorporation of indirect evidence can strengthen evidence in comparisons that were tested head to head.5 

In this living systematic review and network meta-analysis we compare the effects of drug treatments for covid-19. This review is part of the BMJ Rapid Recommendations project, a collaborative effort from the MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation (www.magicproject.org) and TheBMJ.6 
This living systematic review and network meta-analysis will directly inform BMJ Rapid Recommendations6 
on covid-19 treatments, initiated to provide trustworthy, actionable, and living guidance to clinicians and patients soon after new and potentially practice-changing evidence becomes available. The first covid-19 BMJ Rapid Recommendation considered the role of remdesivir7 
(box 
1). This living network meta-analysis is the third version. The previous versions are available in the supplementary material.

Methods 
A protocol provides the detailed methods of this systematic review, including all updates (see supplementary file). We report this living systematic review following the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist for network meta-analyses.8 
A living systematic review is a cumulative synthesis that is updated regularly as new evidence becomes available.9 
The linked BMJ Rapid Recommendations guideline panels approved all decisions relevant to data synthesis. 
Eligibility criteria 
We included randomised clinical trials in people with suspected, probable, or confirmed covid-19 that compared drugs for treatment against one another or against no intervention, placebo, or standard care. We included trials regardless of publication status (peer reviewed, in press, or preprint) or language. No restrictions were applied based on severity of illness or setting and we included trials of Chinese medicines if the drug comprised one or more specific molecules with a defined molecular weight dosing. 
We excluded randomised controlled trials evaluating vaccination, blood products, nutrition, traditional Chinese herbal medicines that include more than one molecule or a molecule without specific molecular weighted dosing, and non-drug supportive care interventions. Trials that evaluated these interventions were identified and categorised separately. 
Information sources 
We perform daily searches from Monday to Friday in the World Health Organization (WHO) covid-19 database for eligible studies 
– a comprehensive multilingual source of global literature on covid-19. Prior to its merge with the WHO covid-19 database on 9 October 2020, we performed daily searches from Monday to Friday in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 Research Articles Downloadable Database for eligible studies.10 
The database includes, but is not limited to the following 25 bibliographic and grey literature sources: Medline (Ovid and PubMed), PubMed Central, Embase, CAB Abstracts, Global Health, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Academic Search Complete, Africa Wide Information, CINAHL, ProQuest Central, SciFinder, the Virtual Health Library, LitCovid, WHO covid-19 website, CDC covid-19 website, Eurosurveillance, China CDC Weekly, Homeland Security Digital Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, bioRxiv (preprints), medRxiv (preprints), chemRxiv (preprints), and SSRN (preprints). 
The daily searches are designed to match the update schedule of the database and to capture eligible studies the day of or the day after publication. To identify randomised controlled trials, we filtered the results from the CDC’s database through a validated and highly sensitive machine learning model.11 
We tracked preprints of randomised controlled trials until publication and updated data to match that in the peer reviewed publication when discrepant and reconciled corrections and retractions existed. 
In addition, we search six Chinese databases monthly: Wanfang, Chinese Biomedical Literature, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, Chinese Medical Journal Net (preprints), and ChinaXiv (preprints). We adapted the search terms for covid-19 developed by the CDC to the Chinese language. For the Chinese literature search, we also included search terms for randomised trials. The supplementary file includes the Chinese literature search strategy. 
We monitor living evidence retrieval services on an ongoing basis. These included the Living Overview of the Evidence (L-OVE) COVID-19 Repository by the Epistemonikos Foundation12 
and the Systematic and Living Map on COVID-19 Evidence by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, in collaboration with the Cochrane Canada Centre at McMaster University.13

We searched all English information sources from 1 December 2019 to 3 December 2020, and the Chinese literature from conception of the databases to 12 November 2020. 
Study selection 
Using a systematic review software, Covidence,14 
pairs of reviewers, following training and calibration exercises, independentlyscreened all titles and abstracts, followed by full texts of trials that were identified as potentially eligible. A third reviewer adjudicated conflicts. 
Data collection 
For each eligible trial, pairs of reviewers, following training and calibration exercises, extracted data independently using a standardised, pilot tested data extraction form. Reviewers collected information on trial characteristics (trial registration, publication status, study status, design), patient characteristics (country, age, sex, smoking habits, comorbidities, setting and type of care, and severity of covid-19 symptoms for studies of treatment), and outcomes of interest (means or medians and measures of variability for continuous outcomes and the number of participants analysed and the number of participants who experienced an event for dichotomous outcomes). Reviewers resolved discrepancies by discussion and, when necessary, with adjudication by a third party. We updated the data collected from included preprints as soon as the peer review publication became available. 
Outcomesof interest wereselected based on importanceto patients and were informed by clinical expertise in the systematic review team and in the linked guideline panel responsible for the WHO-BMJ Rapid Recommendations.7 
The panel includes unconflicted clinical and methodology experts, recruited to ensure global representation, and patient-partners. All panel members rated outcomes from 1 to 9 based on importance to individual patients (9 being most important), and we included any outcome rated 7 or higher by any panel member. Selected outcomes included mortality (closest to 90 days), mechanical ventilation (total number of patients, over 90 days), adverse events leading to discontinuation (within 28 days), viral clearance (closest to 7 days, 3 days either way), admission to hospital, duration of hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, time to symptom resolution or clinical improvement, time to viral clearance, and days free from mechanical ventilation (within 28 days). Viral clearance at seven days and time to viral clearance were included because both may be surrogates for transmissibility, although this is uncertain.15 

Because of the inconsistent reporting observed across trials, we used a hierarchy for the outcome mechanical ventilation in which we considered the total number of patients who received ventilation over the study, if available, and the number of patients ventilated at the time point at which most of the patients were mechanically ventilated, if that is the only way in which this outcome was reported. 
Risk of bias within individual studies 
Foreacheligible trial, reviewers, following training and calibration exercises, used a revision of the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials (RoB 2.0)16 
to rate trials as either at i) low risk of bias, ii) some concerns—probably low risk of bias, iii) some concerns—probably high risk of bias, or iv) high risk of bias, across the following domains: bias arising from the randomisation process; bias owing to departures from the intended intervention; bias from missing outcome data; bias in measurement of the outcome; bias in selection of the reported results, including deviations from the registered protocol; bias due to competing risks; and bias arising from early termination for benefit. We rated trials at high risk of bias overall if one or more domains were rated as some concerns—probably high risk of bias or as high risk of bias and as low risk of bias if all domains were rated as some concerns—probably low risk of bias or low risk of bias. Reviewers resolved discrepancies by discussion and, when not possible, with adjudication by a third party. 
Data synthesis 
We conducted the network meta-analysis using a bayesian framework.17 
In this report, we conducted a network meta-analysis of drug treatments for covid-19 that included all patients, regardless of severity of disease. 
Summary measures 
We summarised theeffect of interventionsondichotomous outcomes using the odds ratio and corresponding 95% credible interval. For continuous outcomes, we used the mean difference and corresponding 95% credible interval in days for ICU length of stay, length of hospital stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation because we expected similar durationsacross randomised controlled trials. For time to symptom resolution and time to viral clearance, we first performed the analyses using the relative effect measure ratio of means and corresponding 95% credible interval before calculating the mean difference in days because we expected substantial variation between studies.18 

Treatment nodes 
Treatments were grouped into common nodes based on molecule and not on dose or duration. For intervention arms with more than one drug, we created a separate node. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were included in the same node for covid-19 specific effects and separated for disease independent adverse effects. We drew network plots using the networkplot command of Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX), with thickness of lines between nodes and size of the nodes based on the inverse of the variance of the direct comparison.19 

Statistical analysis 
For most outcomes, we conducted network meta-analyses and pairwise meta-analyses using a bayesian framework with the same priors for the variance and effect parameters.17 
In previous versions, we used fixed effects for some outcomes because data was sparse or dominated by a single trial. In this update, we used random effects for all outcomes. We used a plausible prior for variance parameter and a uniform prior for the effect parameter suggested in a previous study based on empirical data.20 
For all analyses, we used three Markov chains with 100 000 iterations after an initial burn-in of 10 000 and a thinning of 10. We used node splitting models to assess local incoherence and to obtain indirect estimates.21 
All network meta-analyses were performed using the gemtc package of R version 3.6.3 (RStudio, Boston, MA)22 
and all pairwise meta-analyses using the bayesmeta package.17 

In the first iteration of this living network meta-analysis, some treatment nodes with few total participants and few total events resulted in highly implausible and extremely imprecise effect estimates. We therefore decided to include only treatments that included at least 100 patients or had at least 20 events, based on our impression of the minimum number of patients/events to possibly provide meaningful results.

We assessed the certainty of evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) approach for network meta-analysis.5 
23 
24 
Two people with experience in using GRADE rated each domain for each comparison separately and resolved discrepancies by consensus. We rated the certainty for each comparison and outcome as high, moderate, low, or very low, based on considerations of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, publication bias, intransitivity, incoherence (difference between direct and indirect effects), and imprecision.24 
Judgments of imprecision for this systematic review were made using a minimally contextualised approach, with a null effect as the threshold of importance.25 
The minimally contextualised approach considers only whether credible intervals include the null effect and thus does not consider whether plausible effects, captured by credible intervals, include both important and trivial effects.25 
To evaluate certainty of no benefit (or no effect), we used a 2% risk difference threshold of the 95% credible interval for mortality and mechanical ventilation. In other words, if the entire 95% credible interval was within 2% of the null effect, we would not rate down for imprecision. We decided on this preliminary threshold based on a survey of the authors. In future updates, it will be guided by a survey of patients and guideline panellists. Interim updates and additional study data will be posted on our website (www.covid19lnma.com). 
Interpretation of results 
To facilitate interpretation of the results, we calculated absolute effects for outcomes in which the summary measure was an odds ratio or ratio of means. When available, we inferred baseline risk in the usual care group for each outcome from representative observational data (supplementary material). For mortality, we used data from the CDC on patients who were hospitalised with covid-19.26 
27 
For mechanical ventilation, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalisation, and ICU length of stay we used baseline risks from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection COVID-19 database.28 
For all other outcomes, we used the median from all studies in which participants received standard of care to calculate the baseline risk for each outcome, with each study weighed equally. We calculated absolute effects using the transitive risks model29 
using R2jags package in R.30 

For each outcome, we classified treatments in groups from the most to the least effective using the minimally contextualised framework, which focuses on the treatment effect estimates and the certainty of the evidence.31 

Subgroup and sensitivity analysis 
Subgroup analyses were performed for specific interventions of interest at the direction of the linked WHO living guideline panel. In this iteration, we performed subgroup analyses for remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir. The panel requested subgroup analyses by age (children vs. non-elderly adults vs. elderly) and severity (non-severe vs. severe vs. critical). We performed bayesian hierarchical meta-regression with study as a random effect. 
Patient and public involvement 
Patients were involved in outcome selection, interpretation of results, and the generation of parallel recommendations, as part of the BMJ Rapid Recommendations initiative. 


Results 
After screening 20 228 titles and abstracts and 370 full texts, 130 unique randomised controlled trials from 118 publications were identified that evaluated drug treatments as of 3 December 2020 (fig 
1).32

A table of excluded full texts is provided in the supplementary file. Searches of living evidence retrieval services identified 27 additional eligible randomised controlled trials.65-7278 
-88 
Seventy-three randomised trials have been published in peer reviewed journals, 43 only as preprints, and 17 within two meta-analyses. Most of the trials were registered (117/130; 90%), published in English (113/118; 96%), and evaluated treatment in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 (112/130; 86%). One quarter of the trials were conducted in China (33/130; 25%), with the remainder distributed globally. Of the 130 included drug trials, the three most commonly studied drugs were (hydroxy)chloroquine (33/130; 25%), followed by corticosteroids (11/130; 8%) and lopinavir/ritonavir (8/130; 6%).

The supplementary material presents the differences between study preprint and peer reviewed publications. Eight studies had discrepancies in outcome reporting between the preprint and peer-reviewed publication. Three studies had discrepancies with patient baseline characteristics. No substantiative differences were found for the other four studies. 
All analyses reached convergence based on trace plots and a Brooks-Gelman-Rubin statistic less than 1.05, except comparisons including umifenovir for mortality and tocilizumab for adverse events leading to discontinuation because no patients randomised to either of these drugs died.

met the threshold of analysing treatments with a minimum of 100 patients or 20 events and were included in the network-meta analysis. The treatment nodes included were azithromycin, colchicine, corticosteroids, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, interferon beta, lopinavir-ritonavir, remdesivir, rhG-CSF, tocilizumab, umifenovir, and standard care. Random effects network meta-analysis showed that corticosteroids (odds ratio 0.85, 95% credible interval 0.71 to 1.01; risk difference 17 fewer per 1000, 95% credible interval 34 fewer to 1 more; moderate certainty) probably reduce deaths compared to standard care (fig 
2). Evidence was less certain for remdesivir (odds ratio 0.90, 0.70 to 1.12; risk difference 12 fewer per 1000, 35 fewer to 14 more; low certainty) and lopinavir-ritonavir (odds ratio 0.90, 0.73 to 1.09; risk difference 12 fewer per 1000, 31 fewer to 10 more; low certainty). Patients randomised to hydroxychloroquine (odds ratio 1.10, 0.90 to 1.35; risk difference 11 more per 1000, 11 fewer to 38 more; low certainty of no benefit) and interferon beta (odds ratio 1.02, 0.70 to 1.32; risk difference 2 more per 1000, 35 fewer to 35 more; low certainty) did not have a lower risk of death than those randomised to standard care. 95% credible intervals included both substantial benefit and harm for azithromycin,

colchicine, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, and tocilizumab (all very low certainty). Very low certainty evidence suggests that rhG-CSF may reduce risk of death compared to standard care. Fixed effects network meta-analysis led to similar results for all treatments compared with standard care: corticosteroids (odds ratio 0.86, 0.77 to 0.95), hydroxychloroquine (odds ratio 1.08, 0.96 to 1.22), interferon beta (odds ratio 1.08, 0.89 to 1.30), lopinavir-ritonavir (odds ratio 0.89, 0.80 to 1.00) and remdesivir (odds ratio 0.92, 0.80 to 1.07). 
Mortality data from several small trials on hydroxychloroquine were published in a meta-analysis after the analysis had been completed. To optimally inform the linked WHO guideline panel that considered hydroxychloroquine, we updated the analysis for mortality on 11 November 2020. There were no important differences (supplementary material).

met 
the threshold of analysing treatments with a minimum of 100 patients or 20 events and were included in the network meta-analysis. The treatment nodes included were azithromycin, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, interferon beta, lopinavir-ritonavir, remdesivir, rhG-CSF, and standard care (fig 
2). Random effects network meta-analysis showed that, compared with standard care, corticosteroids probably reduce risk of mechanical ventilation (odds ratio 0.72, 0.50 to 1.01; risk difference 29 fewer per 1000, 54 fewer to 1 fewer; moderate certainty for risk of bias). Certainty was lower for remdesivir (odds ratio 0.68, 0.41 to 1.00; risk difference 33 fewer per 1000, 65 fewer to 1 more; low certainty) and hydroxychloroquine (odds ratio 1.20, 0.83 to 1.81; risk difference 20 more per 1000, 18 fewer to 76 more; low certainty for risk of bias and imprecision). Evidence for was less certain for azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, interferon beta, lopinavir-ritonavir, and tocilizumab, and rhG-CSF (all very low certainty). Fixed effects network meta-analysis led to similar results for all treatments compared with standard care: corticosteroids (odds ratio 0.73, 0.61 to 0.86), remdesivir (odds ratio 0.88, 0.76 to 1.03), hydroxychloroquine (odds ratio 1.16, 0.97 to 1.38), azithromycin (odds ratio 1.13, 0.79 to 1.64), hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (odds ratio 1.59, 0.86 to 2.89), interferon beta (odds ratio 0.97, 0.80 to 1.18), and lopinavir-ritonavir (odds ratio 1.16, 0.98 to 1.36).

met the threshold of analysing treatments with a minimum of 100 patients or 20 events and were included in the network meta-analysis. The treatment nodes included were hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, tocilizumab, and standard care. Moderate certainty evidence showed that remdesivir did not result in a substantial increase in adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation compared with standard care (odds ratio 1.00, 0.37 to 3.83; risk difference 0 more per 1000, 9 fewer to 40 more). Certainty in evidence for hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab was very low (fig

We did not find any convincing evidence that any of the interventions increased the rate of viral clearance (fig

Admission to hospital

reported admission to hospital in patients who were outpatients at baseline. One study of hydroxychloroquine versus placebo was included.103 
There were too few events to make any inferences (odds ratio 0.39, 0.12 to 1.28; risk difference 26 fewer per 1000, 38 fewer to 12 more; low certainty) (fig

Venous thromboembolism 
One study including 20 participants141 
reported venous thromboembolism in patients who received an anticoagulant as the active drug. No treatment node contained information on at least 100 patients, therefore no analyses were conducted for this outcome. 
Clinically-important bleeding 
One study including 20 participants141 
reported clinically important bleeding in patients who received an anticoagulant as the active drug. No treatment node contained information on at least 100 patients, therefore no analyses were conducted for this outcome.

The treatment nodes included were azithromycin, colchicine, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, remdesivir, rhG-CSF, tocilizumab, and standard care. Compared with standard care, duration of hospitalisation was shorter in patients who received colchicine (mean difference -1.57 days, -2.78 to -0.32; low certainty). There was no evidence that azithromycin (very low certainty), corticosteroids (very low certainty), hydroxychloroquine (very low certainty), hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (low certainty), lopinavir-ritonavir (low certainty), tocilizumab (very low certainty), or remdesivir (low certainty), rhG-CSF (low certainty) impact length of stay (fig

There was no evidence that corticosteroids (mean difference -1.41 days, -3.44 to 0.62; low certainty) and remdesivir (mean difference -1.28 days, -4.06 to 1.47; low certainty) reduce duration of mechanical ventilation (fig

121 
The treatment nodes included were azithromycin, corticosteroids, tocilizumab, and standard care. Compared to standard care, corticosteroids (mean difference 2.62 days, 0.24 to 4.97; moderate certainty) may increase ventilator-free days. There was no evidence that tocilizumab (low certainty) and azithromycin (very low certainty) increase ventilator-free days (fig

Subgroups 
Remdesivir have different effects in patients by severity of disease (ratio of odds ratios (ROR) 1.80, CI 1.27 2.59, probability of ROR=1 = 0.0003). The effects of remdesivir on mortality the three subgroups are: non-severe disease (OR 0.71, 0.33 to 1.46), severe disease (OR 0.73, 0.49 to 1.03), critical disease (OR 1.30, 0.89 to 1.97). Using established criteria, we felt that this subgroup effect had low-to-moderate credibility (supplementary material). No other subgroup was notable for any subgroup effects. 

Discussion 
This living systematic review and network meta-analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the evidence for drug treatments of covid-19 up to 21 October 2020 and a comprehensive list of drug trials to 3 December 2020. The certainty of the evidence for most of the comparisons was very low. Corticosteroids probably reduce the risk of death and mechanical ventilation, and increase ventilator-free days, results driven almost entirely by the RECOVERY trial.50 

Whether or not remdesivir has any effect on mortality is uncertain. If one believes the subgroup effect, remdesivir may reduce or have no effect mortality in patients with non-critical disease and may increase or have no effect on mortality in patients with critical illness. The subgroup effect however has only moderate credibility and whether or not remdesivir reduces or increases mortality in any subgroup is uncertain. Direct evidence from randomised controlled trials in patients with covid-19 has so far provided little definitive evidence about adverse effects for most interventions, apart from remdesivir which probably has low risk for adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation. 
No other drug was found to have an impact on any patient with at least moderate certainty for any other outcome. Based on three small trials, colchicine may reduce duration of hospitalisation (low certainty) and based on a single small trial, rhG-CSF might reduce mortality and mechanical ventilation in patients with lymphopenia (low certainty). 
Compared with the second iteration, there are several important updates (box 
2). We now have evidence from several large scale international trials on remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon beta. Unfortunately, the trials showed that none of these interventions had a meaningful effect on any patient important outcomes.

Strengths and limitations of this review 
Our search strategy and eligibility criteria were comprehensive, without restrictions on language of publication or publication status. To ensure expertise in all areas, our team is composed of clinical and methods experts who have undergone training and calibration exercises for all stages of the review process. To minimise problems with counterintuitive results, we anticipated challenges that arise in network meta-analysis when data are sparse.168 
Many of the results for comparisons with sparse data were uninformative and were sometimes implausible. For that reason, we decided to report evidence on treatments for which at least 100 people were randomised or for which there were at least 20 events. In the future, when more data from more treatments are available, our classification of interventions from the most to the least effective will facilitate clear interpretation of results. 
The main limitation of the data is that only nine studies were judged to be at low risk of bias.33

The primary 
limitation of the evidence is lack of blinding, which might introduce bias through differences in co-interventions between randomisation

groups. We chose to consider the treatment arms that did not receive an active experimental drug (ie, placebo or standard care) within the same node: it is possible that the unblinded standard care groups received systematically different co-interventions than groups randomised to receive a placebo. Direct comparisons in which the evidence is dominated by unblinded studies were rated down, consistent with GRADE, for risk of bias and that is reflected in the rating of the quality of evidence from the network estimate.169 
Many of the data also had reporting concerns. For some outcomes, the method in which the researchers measured and reported outcomes proved inconsistent across studies. This led the team to propose a hierarchy for the outcome mechanical ventilation, as described in the methods. 
The living nature of our systematic review and network meta-analysis could conceivably (at least temporarily) amplify publication bias, because studies with promising results are more likely to be published and are published sooner than studies with negative results. The inclusion of preprints, many of which have negative results, might reduce this risk. Industry sponsored trials such as those for remdesivir and other patented drugs could be particularly at risk of publication bias, and positive results for these drugs might require more cautious interpretation than generic drugs tested in randomised controlled trials independent of industry influence. However, the inclusion of preprints in our network meta-analysis might introduce bias from simple errors and the reporting limitations of preprints. We include preprints because of the urgent need for information and because so many of the studies on covid-19 are published first as preprints. So far, there did not appear to be any major differences between preprints and peer-reviewed manuscripts. 
It is possible that we did not detect important subgroup modification.170 
For example, the RECOVERY trial suggested that patients with more severe disease might obtain a greater benefit from dexamethasone than patients with less severe disease.50 
However, this subgroup effect only has moderate credibility. Users should carefully consider the characteristics of the patients included in the trials for each intervention. 
Our living systematic review and network meta-analysis will continue to inform the development of the WHO living guidelines and BMJ Rapid Recommendations.6 
7 
An important difference in the methods for assessing the certainty of the evidence does, however, exist between the two. In this living systematic review and network meta-analysis, we use a minimally contextualised approach for rating the certainty of the evidence, whereas the guideline panels use a fully contextualised approach in which the thresholds of importance of magnitudes of effects depend on all other outcomes and factors involved in the decision.25 
The contextualisation explains differences in the certainty of the evidence between the two. The limitations of potentially misleading results when the network is sparse, and the desirability of focusing on direct estimates from larger studies when this is the case, explain differences in the details of the estimates of effect in this network meta-analysis and in the associated guidelines for remdesivir.7 

To date, we are aware of two other similar efforts to ours.171 
172 
We decided to proceed independently to ensure that the results fully inform clinical decision making for the associated living guidance.6 
We also include a more comprehensive search for the evidence and several differences in analytical methods, which we believe are best suited for this process. It is also important to evaluate the reproducibility and replicability of results from different scientific approaches. 
We will periodically update this living systematic review and network meta-analysis. We from several new randomised trials that examined tocilizumab were published after our statistical analysis and trials on all drugs are being published at an increasingly faster rate. The changes from each version will be highlighted for readers and the most updated version will be the one available in the publication platform. Previous versions will be archived in the supplementary material. This living systematic review and network meta-analysis will also be accompanied by an interactive infographic and a website for users to access the most updated results in a user-friendly format (magicapp.org). 
Conclusions 
Evidence from this living systematic review and network meta-analysis suggests that corticosteroids probably reduce mortality, mechanical ventilation, and ventilator-free days in patients with severe covid-19. Whether or not remdesivir has any impact on any outcome remains uncertain. Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon beta may not reduce mortality or mechanical ventilation, and they seem unlikely to have any other benefits. The effects of most drug interventions are currently highly uncertain, and no definitive evidence exists that other interventions result in important benefits and harms for any outcomes. 
What is already known on this topic 
• Despite huge efforts to identify effective drug interventions for coronavirusdisease2019(covid-19),evidenceforeffectivetreatment remains limited 
What this study adds 
• 
This living systematic review and network meta-analysis provides a comprehensive overview and assessment of the evidence published as of 21 October 2020 and will be updated periodically 

• 
The certainty of the evidence for most interventions tested thus far is low or very low 

• 
In patients with severe covid-19, glucocorticoids probably decrease mortality, mechanical ventilation. No other drug has compelling evidence of benefit.
